Hi there! Rizal here and this is my personal website. I'm a 30-something-year
old software developer living in Jakarta, Indonesia.

This website is a place for me to document my learning and other stuffs.
There's still not much content and I can assure you that it won't change much
in near future. Anyway thanks for visiting. Cheers.
