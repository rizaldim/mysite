<quote>It's me. Mario!</quote>

No, it's not Mario. Rizaldi here. Or as my friends usually call me 'Jal'. I am a 30-something-year-old
guy who lives in Jakarta. I am from Padang, a small city in Sumatera.

I work at a startup as software engineering. Initially I was in Android team, but
wanting to learn more outside of Android (and Java) I asked my team leader if I could move to other
team and he said yes. Now I am in infrastructure team with really not much knowledge about it but
I am learning so much every day.

You can contact me through email: my first name then dot then my last name's first character at gmail.
Or dm me @_rizaldim on twitter.
